# GitHub CLI

`gh` is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with `git` and your code.

GitHub CLI is supported for users on GitHub.com, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, and GitHub Enterprise Server 2.20+ with support for macOS, Windows, and Linux.

## Documentation

For [installation options see below](#installation), for usage instructions [see the manual][manual].

## Contributing

If anything feels off, or if you feel that some functionality is missing, please check out the [contributing page][contributing]. There you will find instructions for sharing your feedback, building the tool locally, and submitting pull requests to the project.

If you are a hubber and are interested in shipping new commands for the CLI, check out our [doc on internal contributions][intake-doc].

### Linux & BSD

`gh` is available via:
- [our Debian and RPM repositories](./docs/install_linux.md);
- community-maintained repositories in various Linux distros;
- OS-agnostic package managers such as [Homebrew](#homebrew), [Conda](#conda), [Spack](#spack), [Webi](#webi); and
- our [releases page][] as precompiled binaries.

For more information, see [Linux & BSD installation](./docs/install_linux.md).

### Windows

`gh` is available via [WinGet][], [scoop][], [Chocolatey][], [Conda](#conda), [Webi](#webi), and as downloadable MSI.

#### WinGet

| ------------------- | --------------------|
| `winget install --id GitHub.cli` | `winget upgrade --id GitHub.cli` |

> [!NOTE]
> The Windows installer modifies your PATH. When using Windows Terminal, you will need to **open a new window** for the changes to take effect. (Simply opening a new tab will _not_ be sufficient.)

### Codespaces

To add GitHub CLI to your codespace, add the following to your [devcontainer file](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/setting-up-your-project-for-codespaces/adding-features-to-a-devcontainer-file):

```json
"features": {
  "ghcr.io/devcontainers/features/github-cli:1": {}
}
```

### GitHub Actions

GitHub CLI comes pre-installed in all [GitHub-Hosted Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners).

### Other platforms

Download packaged binaries from the [releases page][].

#### Verification of binaries

Since version 2.50.0 `gh` has been producing [Build Provenance Attestation](https://github.blog/changelog/2024-06-25-artifact-attestations-is-generally-available/) enabling a cryptographically verifiable paper-trail back to the origin GitHub repository, git revision and build instructions used. The build provenance attestations are signed and relies on Public Good [Sigstore](https://www.sigstore.dev/) for PKI.

There are two common ways to verify a downloaded release, depending if `gh` is already installed or not. If `gh` is installed, it's trivial to verify a new release:

- **Option 1: Using `gh` if already installed:**

  ```shell
  $ % gh at verify -R cli/cli gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Loaded digest sha256:fdb77f31b8a6dd23c3fd858758d692a45f7fc76383e37d475bdcae038df92afc for file://gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Loaded 1 attestation from GitHub API
  âœ“ Verification succeeded!

  sha256:fdb77f31b8a6dd23c3fd858758d692a45f7fc76383e37d475bdcae038df92afc was attested by:
  REPO     PREDICATE_TYPE                  WORKFLOW
  cli/cli  https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1  .github/workflows/deployment.yml@refs/heads/trunk
  ```

- **Option 2: Using Sigstore [`cosign`](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign):**

  To perform this, download the [attestation](https://github.com/cli/cli/attestations) for the downloaded release and use cosign to verify the authenticity of the downloaded release:

  ```shell
  $ cosign verify-blob-attestation --bundle cli-cli-attestation-3120304.sigstore.json \
        --new-bundle-format \
        --certificate-oidc-issuer="https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" \
        --certificate-identity-regexp="^https://github.com/cli/cli/.github/workflows/deployment.yml@refs/heads/trunk$" \
        gh_2.62.0_macOS_arm64.zip
  Verified OK
  ```

### Build from source

See here on how to [build GitHub CLI from source][build from source].

## Comparison with hub

For many years, [hub][] was the unofficial GitHub CLI tool. `gh` is a new project that helps us explore
what an official GitHub CLI tool can look like with a fundamentally different design. While both
tools bring GitHub to the terminal, `hub` behaves as a proxy to `git`, and `gh` is a standalone
tool. Check out our [more detailed explanation][gh-vs-hub] to learn more.

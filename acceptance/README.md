## Acceptance Tests

The acceptance tests are blackbox* tests that are expected to interact with resources on a real GitHub instance.  They are built on top of the [`go-internal/testscript`](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/rogpeppe/go-internal/testscript) package, which provides a framework for building tests for command line tools.

*Note: they aren't strictly blackbox because `exec gh` commands delegate to a binary set up by `testscript` that calls into `ghcmd.Main`. However, since our real `func main` is an extremely thin adapter over `ghcmd.Main`, this is reasonable. This tradeoff avoids us building the binary ourselves for the tests, and allows us to get code coverage metrics.

### Running the Acceptance Tests

The acceptance tests have a build constraint of `//go:build acceptance`, this means that `go test ./...` will continue to work without any modifications. The `acceptance` tag must therefore be provided when running `go test`.

The following environment variables are required:

#### `GH_ACCEPTANCE_HOST`

The GitHub host to target e.g. `github.com`

#### `GH_ACCEPTANCE_ORG`

The organization in which the acceptance tests can manage resources in. Consider using `gh-acceptance-testing` on `github.com`.

#### `GH_ACCEPTANCE_TOKEN`

The token to use for authenticatin with the `GH_ACCEPTANCE_HOST`. This must already have the necessary scopes for each test, and must have permissions to act in the `GH_ACCEPTANCE_ORG`. See [Effective Test Authoring](#effective-test-authoring) for how tests must handle tokens without sufficient scopes.

It's recommended to create and use a Legacy PAT for this; Fine-Grained PATs do not offer all the necessary privileges required. You can use an OAuth token provided via `gh auth login --web` and can provide it to the acceptance tests via `GH_ACCEPTANCE_TOKEN=$(gh auth token --hostname <host>)` but this can be a bit confusing and annoying if you `gh auth login` again without `-s` and lose the required scopes.

---

A full example invocation can be found below:

```
GH_ACCEPTANCE_HOST=<host> GH_ACCEPTANCE_ORG=<org> GH_ACCEPTANCE_TOKEN=<token> go test -tags=acceptance ./acceptance
```

While writing a new test, it can be useful to target that specific script by providing the `GH_ACCEPTANCE_SCRIPT` env var in combination with the `-run` flag, for example:

```
GH_ACCEPTANCE_SCRIPT=pr-view.txtar GH_ACCEPTANCE_HOST=<host> GH_ACCEPTANCE_ORG=<org> GH_ACCEPTANCE_TOKEN=<token> go test -tags=acceptance -run ^TestPullRequests$ ./acceptance
```

#### Code Coverage

To get code coverage, `go test` can be invoked with `coverpkg` and `coverprofile` like so:

```
GH_ACCEPTANCE_HOST=<host> GH_ACCEPTANCE_ORG=<org> GH_ACCEPTANCE_TOKEN=<token> go test -tags=acceptance -coverprofile=coverage.out -coverpkg=./... ./acceptance
```

### Writing Tests

This section is to be expanded over time as we write more tests and learn more.

#### Environment Variables

The following custom environment variables are made available to the scripts:
 * `GH_HOST`: Set to value of the `GH_ACCEPTANCE_ORG` env var provided to `go test`
 * `ORG`: Set to the value of the `GH_ACCEPTANCE_ORG` env var provided to `go test`
 * `GH_TOKEN`: Set to the value of the `GH_ACCEPTANCE_TOKEN` env var provided to `go test`
 * `RANDOM_STRING`: Set to a length 10 random string of letters to help isolate globally visible resources
 * `SCRIPT_NAME`: Set to the name of the `testscript` currently running, without extension and replacing hyphens with underscores e.g. `pr_view`
 * `HOME`: Set to the initial working directory. Required for `git` operations
 * `GH_CONFIG_DIR`: Set to the initial working directory. Required for `gh` operations

#### Custom Commands

The following custom commands are defined within [`acceptance_test.go`](./acceptance_test.go) to help with writing tests:

- `defer`: register a command to run after the testscript completes

  ```txtar
  # Defer repo cleanup
  defer gh repo delete --yes $ORG/$SCRIPT_NAME-$RANDOM_STRING
  ```

- `env2upper`: set environment variable to the uppercase version of another environment variable

  ```txtar
  # Prepare organization secret, GitHub Actions uppercases secret names
  env2upper ORG_SECRET_NAME=$RANDOM_STRING
  ```

- `replace`: replace placeholders in file with interpolated content provided

  ```txtar
  env2upper SECRET_NAME=$SCRIPT_NAME_$RANDOM_STRING

  # Modify workflow file to use generated organization secret name
  mv ../workflow.yml .github/workflows/workflow.yml
  replace .github/workflows/workflow.yml SECRET_NAME=$SECRET_NAME

  -- workflow.yml --
  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
  env:
    ORG_SECRET: ${{ secrets.$SECRET_NAME }}
  ```

- `stdout2env`: set environment variable containing standard output from previous command

  ```txtar
  # Create the PR
  exec gh pr create --title 'Feature Title' --body 'Feature Body' --assignee '@me' --label 'bug'
  stdout2env PR_URL
  ```

### Acceptance Test VS Code Support

Due to the `//go:build acceptance` build constraint, some functionality is limited because `gopls` isn't being informed about the tag. To resolve this, set the following in your `settings.json`:

```json
  "gopls": {
    "buildFlags": [
        "-tags=acceptance"
    ]
  },
```

You can install the [`txtar`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brody715.txtar) or [`vscode-testscript`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twpayne.vscode-testscript) extensions to get syntax highlighting.

### Debugging Tests

When tests fail they fail like this:

```

```

This is generally enough information to understand why a test has failed. However, we can get more information by providing the `-v` flag to `go test`, which turns on verbose mode and shows each command and any associated `stdio`.

By default `testscript` removes the directory in which it was running the script, and if you've been a conscientious engineer, you should be cleaning up resources using the `defer` statement. However, this can be an impediment to debugging. As such you can set `GH_ACCEPTANCE_PRESERVE_WORK_DIR=true` and `GH_ACCEPTANCE_SKIP_DEFER=true` to skip these cleanup steps.

### Effective Test Authoring

This section is to be expanded over time as we write more tests and learn more.

#### Test Isolation

The `testscript` library creates a somewhat isolated environment for each script. Each script gets a directory with limited environment variables by default. As far as reasonable, we should look to write scripts that depend on nothing more than themselves, the GitHub resources they manage, and limited additional environmental injection from our own `testscript` setup.

Here are some guidelines around test isolation:
 * Favour duplication in test setup over abstracting a new `testscript` command
 * Favour a `testscript` owning an entire resource lifecycle over shared resource until we see a performance or rate limiting issue
 * Use the `RANDOM_STRING` env var for globally visible resources to avoid conflicts

### Debris

Since these scripts are creating resources on a GitHub instance, we should try our best to cleanup after them. Use the `defer` keyword to ensure a command runs at the end of a test even in the case of failure.

#### Scope Validation

TODO: I believe tests should early exit if the correct scopes aren't in place to execute the entire lifecycle. It's extremely annoying if a `defer` fails to clean up resources because there's no `delete_repo` scope for example. However, I'm not sure yet whether this scope checking should be in the Go tests or in the scripts themselves. It seems very cool to understand required scopes for a script just by looking at the script itself.

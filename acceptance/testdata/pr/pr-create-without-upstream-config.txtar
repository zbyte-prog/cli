# This test is the same as pr-create-basic, except that the git push doesn't include the -u argument
# This causes a git config read to fail during gh pr create, but it should not be fatal

# Use gh as a credential helper
exec gh auth setup-git

# Create a repository with a file so it has a default branch
exec gh repo create $ORG/$SCRIPT_NAME-$RANDOM_STRING --add-readme --private

# Defer repo cleanup
defer gh repo delete --yes $ORG/$SCRIPT_NAME-$RANDOM_STRING

# Clone the repo
exec gh repo clone $ORG/$SCRIPT_NAME-$RANDOM_STRING

# Prepare a branch to PR
cd $SCRIPT_NAME-$RANDOM_STRING
exec git checkout -b feature-branch
exec git commit --allow-empty -m 'Empty Commit'
exec git push origin feature-branch

# Create the PR
exec gh pr create --title 'Feature Title' --body 'Feature Body'

# Check the PR is indeed created
exec gh pr view
stdout 'Feature Title'
